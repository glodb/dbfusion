// Package connections contains interfaces that define the fundamental layout for managing connections to databases.
// This package plays a pivotal role in the DBFusion framework, as it provides the foundation for handling connections
// and querying databases. It is designed to abstract the differences between SQL and NoSQL databases, allowing for
// seamless interaction with various database systems.
//
// The interfaces within this package serve as a bridge between the DBFusion framework and specific database systems.
// They define methods for establishing, managing, and querying connections, thereby enabling uniform access to different
// types of databases.
//
// Usage:
// To use this package effectively, import it into your Go code and implement the provided interfaces for your chosen
// database systems. These interfaces allow you to define how connections are established and queries are executed
// in a database-specific manner.
//
// Example:
//   // Import the connections package
//   import "github.com/globdb/dbfusion/connections"
//
// Note:
// This package is extensible and allows adding support for additional database systems by implementing the provided
// interfaces in a database-specific package. It serves as a critical component in the DBFusion framework for handling
// connections and queries.
