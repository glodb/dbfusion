// Package set provides a dynamic set implementation for Golang using generic maps.
// Golang does not have a built-in set data structure, but with generics support,
// this package allows developers to efficiently manage unique elements in a collection.
// Use this package to simplify operations like adding, removing, and checking for
// the existence of elements in a set-like data structure.
