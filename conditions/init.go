// Package conditions provides functionality to convert conditional data for various database systems.
// It is designed around the DBFusionData interface, which defines methods that each database system
// must implement to handle conditional data.
//
// The primary purpose of this package is to abstract the conversion of conditional data structures
// into formats suitable for specific database systems. Each database system, such as MySQL or MongoDB,
// should implement the DBFusionData interface to enable proper handling of conditional data.
//
// Usage:
// To use this package, import it into your Go code and leverage the provided functionality to
// convert conditional data structures according to the requirements of your chosen database system.
//
// Example:
//   // Import the conditions package
//   import "github.com/globdb/dbfusion/conditions"
//
//
// Note:
// This package is extensible and allows adding support for additional database systems by
// implementing the DBFusionData interface in a database-specific package.
